# Project 9 of 100 for Python Bootcamp
- Coded a silent auction using python & ASCII art

# How it Works
- Game asks user for their name & bid amount
- Game then asks if there are any additional bids from other users
- Once there are no more bids, the auction announces the name of the highest bidder & their bid
